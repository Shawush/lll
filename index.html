            <!-- Video games paragraph -->
            <p>Video games are one of my biggest hobbies and were my gate into computer science.
              I've always been intrigued by the framework and background of games. Knowing all the
              background of mechanics functions has always been a question I have and I am now learning Computer
              Science and game development as a result of my love of games.

          <td>
            <!-- Sports paragraph -->
            <p>Sports have been a hobby of mine since a kid. I've always had a love for sports and activity.
              It serves as a stress reliever and helps me take a break in between work so I do not overload.
              It helps clear the mind and regain focus when you need to stop and take a breather in between
              work.
            </p>
          </td>

          <td>
            <!-- Travel paragraph -->
            <p>When I'm not learning or working I love to travel. Traveling lets you see the world in different
              ways. Seeing how different societies function and how they incorporate technology helps you see
              how technologies simplify. Technology is a means of simplifying our lives and when I visit countries
              that are not as techlogically advanced. You get a love for technology and its way of simplifying our
              lives.

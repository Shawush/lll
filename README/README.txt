CSCI 1170 : Assignment 2

## Omar Melad Shawush B00945281

### these are the files within the folder index.html,Contact-Me.html,Skills-And-Projects.html each are somewhat self explanatory but Index is my homepage with just facts about myself,Contact me is the page for all my social media and contact information as well as a form to submit info, skills and projects is a page with my previous work and coding languages. I reused my html and css from previous assignment and built on it with JavaScript.

#### This code is for my personal resume/portfolio site. It showcases my previous work,skills,contact information in hopes of getting recognition as a proficient coder. I would like this website to shwocase my skills as a coder and help me secure jobs, internships, and coops in the future. The code is made to appear userfriendly to the user as it follows CRAP priniciples. For this assignment I changed the media query to account for different sized devices. Checked for correct information being typed into contact form. And added color pallets in the nav.
